    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Tin, and I developed this vocabulary management application as a way to demonstrate my skills with Vue.js and full-stack development. Below are some of the key features I implemented:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CRUD operations for vocabulary words</li>
      <li>Usage of Vue Router for navigation between different components</li>
      <li>Integration with a MongoDB database via an Express API</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
